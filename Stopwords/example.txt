Independence Day is a National Festival of India celebrated on 15th of August every year. India became a free country on this day and it's only then we could secure our democratic rights as citizens of India. Our Independence gives us the reason to enjoy our fundamental rights laid down by the constitution. We are now a self-governed democratic country and have the voting rights. The feeling of self-reliance and freedom fills the heart of the citizens with supreme happiness and joy. It is all due to the tireless efforts and numerous sacrifices of several great people who sacrificed their lives without any fear.
